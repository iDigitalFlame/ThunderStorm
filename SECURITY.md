# Security Policy

As ThunderStorm is a _security tool_, integrity and trust in the tooling (ie:
_ThunderStorm itself_) is one of the most important things to ensure for people
using this software.

Monitoring bugs and potential issues is an ongoing task and we make the best effort
to ensure high quality code. However, there is always a possibility of things falling
through the cracks.

## Supported Versions

ThunderStorm is a continuously updated software solution, and as such, the best
way to ensure protection against vulnerabilities and issues it ensure that you are
running the latest version of ThunderStorm, mainly from a release version (as they
are considered more stable than the git base).

## Security Bounties and Reporting

If in the event that you find any vulnerabilities, please report any high severity
vulnerabilities via email to `ts <at> idfla.me` and report any lower severity
vulnerabilities using the GitHub issues system with the `security` issue tag.
